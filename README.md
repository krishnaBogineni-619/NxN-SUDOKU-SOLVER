**N*N SUDOKU SOLVER**

Focuses on solving the Sudoku puzzle using two approaches: **Brute Force** and **Backtracking**. 

Key Points

1. **Introduction**: 
   - A brief overview of Sudoku as a 9x9 grid puzzle where each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid must contain digits 1-9 without repetition.

2. **Sudoku Rules**:
   - Each row and column must contain the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
   - Numbers in each 3x3 block should not repeat.
   - The sum of every row, column, and nonet must equal 45.
   - Only one unique solution exists for each puzzle.

3. **Problem Statement**:
   - Objective: To fill the grid while adhering to the above rules using two approaches:
     1. **Brute Force Approach**.
     2. **Backtracking Approach**.

4. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - This method generates all combinations to fill empty cells and checks each one for validity.
   - An algorithm is provided that iterates through numbers and validates them at each step, checking the matrix.

5. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - This method incrementally fills the grid and backtracks when invalid numbers are detected.
   - More efficient compared to brute force as it doesnâ€™t explore all possibilities.

6. **Algorithm Details**:
   - Pseudocode for both brute force and backtracking is provided.

7. **Comparison of Approaches**:
   - Brute force explores all possibilities.
   - Backtracking is more efficient as it skips unworthy options.
   - Backtracking requires fewer steps and is preferred.

8. **Time and Space Complexity**:
   - Both approaches have a time complexity of **O(N^(N*N))** and a space complexity of **O(N*N)**.

9. **Applications of Sudoku**:
   - Improves concentration, reduces stress, promotes a healthy mindset, and enhances memory.
   - Used in AI for training bots, solving mathematical problems, and steganography.
